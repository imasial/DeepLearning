# **Deep Learning Project: Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition**

:
Welcome to my Deep Learning Project, One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

I apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## **Objective**
----------------

My primary goal is to develop models capable of accurately recognizing digits in real-world street images. The project aims to compare the performance of different architectures, including fully connected feedforward neural networks and CNNs, to select the most effective model

## **Dataset**
-------------

Here, I will use a subset of the original data to save some computation time. The dataset is provided as a .h5 file. The basic preprocessing steps have been applied on the dataset.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.
